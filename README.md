# Python-Turtle - Geometry and Geometric Patterns

This Python Turtle program has a series of geometric patterns which I've created. 

The functions are all named after Eygptian Gods and Deities. I have designed them so that they can all be varied when each function is referenced. 

Each function starts with a simple 0/1 on-off command. 

I will start to export out each pattern as it's own PY file, and these will be described in the Wiki, but they are all available within the HORUS.PY file - which is how I use them as I combine them together to make random patterns.

The patterns are divided into four key sections:

 - Geometric Tiled Patterns
 - Based Shapes - Which all build up from 0,0
 - Circular Patterns - Concentric circle patterns
 - Axis/Kaleidoscopic Patterns - Patterns that build upwards, then repeated kaleidoscopic-style using "Shu" to control the number of axis. 

I am not a developer or coder so there are a lot of things to correct and standardise, but I have tried to create something which demostrates some complex geometric elements that can be manipulated with one or two number changes. I am not a mathematician (terrible at it infact) either so there are a few things that can be improved there too. I have learned a lot from people sharing information so I thought it would be appropriate to share what I have learned in return.

There will be more functions developed over time.
